### About the dataset

##### Context
This is the dataset used in the second chapter of Aurélien Géron's recent book 'Hands-On Machine learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow'. It serves as an excellent introduction to implementing machine learning algorithms because it requires rudimentary data cleaning, has an easily understandable list of variables and sits at an optimal size between being to toyish and too cumbersome.

##### Content
The data pertains to the houses found in a given California district and some summary stats about them based on the 1990 census data.

##### Acknowledgements
This data was initially featured in the following paper:
Pace, R. Kelley, and Ronald Barry. "Sparse spatial autoregressions." Statistics & Probability Letters 33.3 (1997): 291-297.

and I encountered it in 'Hands-On Machine learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow' by Aurélien Géron.

This dataset is a modified version of the California Housing dataset available from:

What I tried to do in this project is focusing on pipelines to make preprocessing steps easier and better. Specifically if the dataset is going to be updated we are assured that the data is going through all the steps.

Final Note: Every part of the code is explained in the description in the notebook so I won't bother myself with it again.
